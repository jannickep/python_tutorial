# Python Tutorial

This is a bare bones introduction to analyzing data in python for first year physics students. 

Clone or download the repository to start running it. 

Open python_tutorial_2018.html in your browser for the tutorial (a pdf version is also available, but it is less readable). 

The python_tutorial_2018.ipynb is provided, but if you are just starting to learn python I would recommend doing the tutorial from the html or pdf file so that you have to manually understand each line of code.
