# Python Tutorial

This is a bare bones introduction to analyzing data in python.

Open python_tutorial_2018.html for the tutorial. 

The python_tutorial_2018.ipynb is provided, but if you are just starting to learn python I would recommend doing the tutorial from the html file so that you have to manually understand each line of code.
