# Python Tutorial

This is a bare bones introduction to analyzing data in python for first year physics students. 

Clone or download the repository and then open python_tutorial_2018.html in your browser for the tutorial (a pdf version is also available, but is a little less readable). 

The python_tutorial_2018.ipynb is provided if you just want to run the code. If you are just starting to learn python I would recommend doing the tutorial step-by-step from the instructions in the html or pdf file so that you can manually understand each line of code.
